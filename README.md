# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System (OOP in Python)

This is a simple **console-based movie ticket booking system** built using **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in Python. It simulates a basic theater system where users can:

✅ View currently running movies  
✅ See available seats  
✅ Book a seat for a show
